    Excellent place to take a Mazda Bongo, and also many other popular cars and
    vans, as they do a thorough job, at a very reasonable price compared to
    many other garages.

    Friendly very helpful reliable trustworthy. As a Bongo owning female it is
    really reassuring to be able to trust the workmanship and advice that this
    garage gives. And I DO enquire and ask for specific answers which are
    always given honestly. I know these lads have high standards and will go
    the extra mile, and their expertise with Bongo/Friendees is most reliable.
    Sadly have moved 250 miles away from this garage, but am happy to travel
    back for annual servicing etc.

    I've been going to ADS for quite a few years and found them extremely
    helpful and always giving me the best advice and won't use anybody else.
